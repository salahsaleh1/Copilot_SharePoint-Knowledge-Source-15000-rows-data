# Copilot_SharePoint-Knowledge-Source-15000-rows-data
Copilot Agent to query SharePoint List Knowledge source with 15000 rows of data.


This Copilot Studio agent is designed to intelligently translate user questions about a libraryâ€™s book catalog into precise OData $filter strings for querying a SharePoint list. It ensures natural language queries are converted into valid, structured expressions that match the schema of the catalog. By automatically handling text searches, numeric and date comparisons, and publisher name normalization, the agent helps users quickly find books without needing technical knowledge. It also supports combining multiple conditions to answer complex queries, making library searches seamless and efficient.
